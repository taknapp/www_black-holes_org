# Introduction

The Spectral Einstein Code (SpEC) is a flexible infrastructure for
solving partial differential equations using multi-domain spectral
methods. While SpEC was primarily designed for fully
general-relativistic compact object simulations, it can be applied to
a wide range of hyperbolic and elliptic equations. Some of its
features are:

- A flexible domain decomposition supporting individual subdomains
  (cells, elements) of various topologies, e.g. blocks, spheres,
  cylinders, and any combination thereof. Subdomains can touch or
  overlap.
- Solves hyperbolic and elliptic PDEs.
- Interfaces to the visualization software ParaView and VisIt.

The main application area of SpEC lies in simulating compact binary
objects. Specifically, it is one of the most accurate and efficient
codes to compute the gravitational waveforms for inspiraling and
coalescing binary black holes.
